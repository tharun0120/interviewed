#### Workflow

- Login as a HR and schedule a virtual interview/assesment to a candidate with their information like email, etc.

- As the interview/assessment is scheduled candidates receive an email with the link for taking the assessment with their credentials and instructions for taking the test.

- The candidates are presented with a set of predefined questions and they can project their responses which is recorded in real time.

- Once the candidate completes the final question the recorded video is then pushed to the azure blobs.

- The HR can view the dashboard for the status of the scheduled interview and if the test is completed by the candidate the HR can download the video of the particular candidate for assessing.
